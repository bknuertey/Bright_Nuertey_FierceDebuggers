A curious person by nature, I have always been fascinated by how technology can be leveraged to solve daily problems. I still remember how I used to tinker with old VHS players in figuring out how they work. Getting my first computer made me realize I would like to work in the technology field as it opened up a whole new world to me.

The other thing I liked apart from working in the technology field is working with people. Throughout my high school years, I provided solutions to people who had faulty mobile phones and computers which earned me the nickname IT expert.

I finally landed a role where I could help people with problems as a professional and this gave me great joy. My curiosity about software led me to learn how to build software from various institutions which made available to me more resources than I could ever have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms and the processes involved in building software.

My time spent being a software tester has also helped me to develop a critical eye when dealing with software to make sure users find the most pleasure when using them. Quality and customer satisfaction with a product is what I aim for and this is what drives me daily to give my best in finding and helping to eliminate most bugs in any software project I work on.

There is more to learn, more problems to solve, and yet more people to help. This is what piques my curiosity to learn more in the ever-changing technological world.
